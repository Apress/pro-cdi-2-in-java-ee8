# Errata for *Pro CDI 2.0 in Java EE 8*

## Chapter 6 - Decorators and interceptors 

On **page 166** Missing interface requirement]:
 
The example of a bean being decorated on page 166 is incorrect. A requirement for a bean to be decorated is that the bean implements an interface. 
This requirement is also not reflected in the surrounding text. The [example code](chapter6-decorators-and-interceptors/166-greeting-decorator-bean) 
has been updated to reflect this.
